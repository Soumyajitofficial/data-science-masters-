    "\"sys.version\" is used to find out the version of pytho.Currently i am working on \"'3.10.8 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Nov 22 2022, 08:26:04) [GCC 10.4.0]'\".\n",

    "Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda\" functions. Lambda functions are also known as anonymous functions because they don't require a formal function definition with a name. Instead, they can be created inline and used where they are defined.\n",

    "Python provides a wide range of built-in function such as \n",
    "\n",
    "1)print(): Prints the specified message or object to the standard output.\n",
    "2)len(): Returns the length (number of items) of an object, such as a string, list, or tuple.\n",
    "3)type(): Returns the type of an object.\n",
    "4)input(): Allows user input from the console and returns it as a string.\n",
    "5)str(): Converts an object into a string representation.\n",
    "6)int(): Converts a number or a string to an integer.\n",
    "7)float(): Converts a number or a string to a floating-point number.\n",
    "8)list(): Creates a new list object or converts an iterable to a list.\n",
    "9)tuple(): Creates a new tuple object or converts an iterable to a tuple.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the official Python style guide, known as PEP 8, it is recommended to keep the length of identifiers under 79 characters for readability.however in practice Python interpreters can handle identifiers of much longer lengths without issues. The length of identifiers is limited by factors such as system memory and the maximum size of strings that can be stored. These limits are implementation-dependent and can vary across different Python environments and versions.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several benefits of using Python as a programming language. Here are some key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Readability and Simplicity : Python emphasizes code readability and uses a clean and straightforward syntax. Its code is easy to understand and write, making it accessible for beginners and reducing the time required for development and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Versatility: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has extensive support for various domains such as web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Its extensive standard library and numerous third-party packages contribute to its versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Large and Active Community: Python has a large and active community of developers worldwide. This vibrant community contributes to the growth of Python by creating and maintaining libraries, frameworks, and tools. The community support ensures that you can find solutions, resources, and assistance easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Third-Party Libraries and Ecosystem: Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities. Popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, and many more provide powerful functionality for data manipulation, scientific computing, web development, and machine learning. This extensive library ecosystem saves development time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable. Python programs can run seamlessly across different operating systems, which is beneficial for collaborative projects and deployment on different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Productivity and Rapid Development: Python's simplicity and ease of use contribute to increased productivity. Its concise syntax and large standard library enable developers to write code faster and complete projects more quickly. The availability of frameworks and tools further accelerates the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Integration Capabilities: Python can be easily integrated with other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java. This allows developers to leverage existing codebases and libraries written in different languages, enhancing code reusability and interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Scalability and Performance: While Python is not considered the fastest language in terms of execution speed, it offers good performance for most use cases. Additionally, Python allows for seamless integration with high-performance languages like C, which can be used to optimize critical sections of code for enhanced performance.\n",
